write in terminal : git push -u origin master
our main branch is master
and then just after making any commit ,keep on doing just 'git push'

to commit:
git status: tells untracked, modified files
git add . : adds all modified files, takes them to staging area
git commit -m "commit name" : commits files
git push: pushes files to remote repo
